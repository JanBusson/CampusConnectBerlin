         description="I'm doing a dual degree in IT & Management and mostly spend my time optimizing things â€“ systems, workflows, even my daily routine. I like strategy games, geopolitics, and efficient apps. Some people say I'm intense, but I just really like ideas. I'd love to meet people who challenge me intellectually but also help me take things less seriously."),

         description="Originally from Argentina, I came to Berlin for philosophy, art theory, and (let's be honest) to argue about everything from Nietzsche to NFTs.
